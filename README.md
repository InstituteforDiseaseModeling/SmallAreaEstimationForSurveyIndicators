# SmallAreaEstimationForSurveyIndicators

There are multiple goals for this project and repository.  One aim was to develop a custom, but fairly automated R-based framework to estimate survey indicators using small area estimation techniques at the subnational and demographic subgroup scale.  Concurrently, we also aimed to provide novel contributions to the family planning (FP) scientific community by providing detailed estimates of FP indicators subnationally and by demographic subgroups.  This is a research tool that we are providing open source to go along with published research and web-based visualization of the results.

## Data Availability

The framework separates the code from the rawdata and the output folders. The rawdata includes survey data from the demographic health survey (DHS) and shapefiles from GADM.  Thata data are publicly available and would need to be downloaded by each user. 

## Starting a new project

Starting a new project is fairly easy.  There is a master main file at the head of the code; this R script is an example of how to run the entire modeling pipeline and produce some plots of the outputs.  The current example *should* be executable for examples in the family planning space.  You need to set the working directory, where the raw data is located (after downloading the associated DHS and shapefile data), and modify the config_paths.R for your own setup.  There is also a line to define the project configuration file.  There are several example configuration files in the folder to start with.  I have provided a surveyCodeBook.xlsx that lists the DHS files that are included in this project and the corresponding stratification variables.  That file is located in the general utilities folder in the repository here; you may need to change the variable pathToMasterSurveyList in the Config_project.R depending on where you store that file.  

Creating a new configuration file requires two parts:  a configuration input file and adding project specific utils required for the framework.  At this point, there is only one required file called add_DHS_indicators.R in the project specific utils.  In this file, you, as a user, must translate the survey codes to the variable names that were exactly described in the configuration file.  This is for both the outcome survey indicators and the demographic subgroups.    

## Environment

The following is the current environment I'm using to run the framework. I plan to develop a docker and conda environment for the framework in the future.
